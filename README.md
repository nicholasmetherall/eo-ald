Earth Observation Assessment of Loss and Damage - collated repositories and case studies

This paper aims to provide an overview of how the monitoring of these various elements of climate risk: hazards, assets and vulnerability can be implemented through Earth Observation for Assessment of Loss and Damage (EO-ALD). This approach aims to operationalise data-driven, standardised and replicable EO workflows. In order to do so, the paper draws on three case studies of EO-ALD. It then proceeds to generate new data and a novel case study of how EO data can be applied in monitoring actions to reduce climate risk. Each of these four case studies has their own associated methods. Each of the case study data sources and analytical steps for replication are available in the following repositories via the following links, respectively.
