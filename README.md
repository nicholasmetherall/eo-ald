Earth Observation Assessment of Loss and Damage - collated repositories and case studies

This paper provides overview of Earth Observation of Loss and Damage (EO-ALD) including monitoring of the elements of climate risk: hazards, assets and vulnerability. The paper draws on three case studies of EO-ALD. It then proceeds to generate new data and a novel case study of how EO data can be applied in monitoring actions to reduce climate risk.
